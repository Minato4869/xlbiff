*   Get window x,y coords on Unrealize so if it's been moved, it pops up in
    the same place when we next Realize it.

*   Do like xbiffR5, popdown window if mailbox file is read?

*   Think of something to do if there are more than maxRows lines.  My
    guess would be to add scroll bars.

*   -refresh <time> flag, for when you pop it down and forget you have mail,
    perhaps it could re-pop-up every 30 minutes or so?
