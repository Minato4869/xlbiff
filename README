This is xlbiff, the X Literate Biff.

Xlbiff lurks in the background, monitoring your mailbox file (normally
/usr/spool/mail/<yourusername>).  When something shows up there, it
invokes the MH scan(1) command and displays the output in a window.
Clicking the left mouse button anywhere in the window causes it to
vanish.  It will also vanish if you inc(1) and the mailbox becomes 
empty.  Xlbiff is a lot like xconsole -- its job is to sit invisibly
and pop up only when something demands your attention.


INSTALLING

Edit the Makefile and type `make'.  If that works,  type `make install'
or just xrdb the resources yourself and type `xlbiff'.


PORTING (or, if INSTALLING didn't work)

Xlbiff has been tested only on one DECstation 5000 running Ultrix 4.2 
and X11R5.  It compiles under cc and gcc, but not under DEC ANSI C for
reasons I haven't bothered to investigate.  The only things I can imagine
causing trouble are the use of alarm(3) and getlogin/getpwuid(3).  If
fixes are required, or if you add any whizzy features, please mail them
to me (santiago@lerad.pa.dec.com) and I will take care of the normal 
release nonsense.

Xlbiff comes with a Makefile, not an 

BACKGROUND

I wrote xlbiff because I don't always want to read my mail.  Xbiff, from
the X distribution, lets me know when I have mail but not what it is -- this
makes me have to inc(1) just so I can decide if I want to bother reading 
it.  Xlbiff gives me a much better indication of whether or not I want to
take time to read a new message.

Before xlbiff, I wrote a crude hack using perl and xmessage.  It worked,
but I had always wanted to do it right.  This is it, I hope.
