*   BUG: <from jnelson@gauche.zko.dec.com (Jeff E. Nelson)>:
    Xlbiff window grabs keyboard focus when it pops up.

*   put binary count of messages in LEDs?  Or is that too geeky?

*   BUG: *bottom doesn't interoperate with tvtwm's 'Sticky' feature.

*   Do like xbiffR5, popdown window if mailbox file is read?  nah.

*   Think of something to do if there are more than maxRows lines.  My
    guess would be to add scroll bars.

*   <from gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu> pop up alert window on error

*   Handle width resizes

*   Handle signals gracefully (ie, turn off LED if killed by ^C)
